  <h1>Towards Reparative Research</h1>
  <p><em>(Sharon Stein & Evan Bowness)</em></p>
  <button onclick="togglePreamble()">How to use this deck</button>
  <div id="preamble" class="preamble">
    <p>Even when research claims to be reparative, it often smuggles in old habits: the desire for mastery, the expectation of certainty, the assumption that knowledge is something to extract rather than something to be in relationship with. Knowledge-making, under these conditions, becomes another form of possession—one more way to accumulate, enclose, and control. This deck invites you to instead approach research as a set of relations. What happens when we treat research not as a tool of extraction, but as a field of entanglement.</p>
    <p>This deck does not offer answers, or straight paths. Instead, it threads its way through paradigms, loosening hardened assumptions, breaking down what no longer serves. It asks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What culturally-embedded assumptions are we unknowingly bringing to our research?</li>
      <li>What if research wasn’t about accumulating knowledge, but about composting harm?</li>
      <li>Where have we mistaken control for care?</li>
      <li>When is research not the appropriate response to harm?</li>
      <li>Where do we still refuse to be undone, even when undoing is necessary for repair?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are no clean or quick fixes here. Repair is not an event; it’s a multi-layered, non-linear metabolic process. It requires ongoing work, attention, and the willingness to be undone. It might result in new knowledge, but it also holds space for what cannot be known, should not be known, or refuses to be known.</p>
    <p><strong>How to use this deck:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shuffle the cards and see which one finds you. Sit with the questions on your own or as a group, or start your lab meetings by collectively processing one of the cards.</li>
      <li>Rather than simply answer the questions, consider what emotional and intellectual responses they bring up for you (you might have multiple responses that contradict each other). Which of your assumptions and investments do the questions challenge or affirm? What resistances do they activate? What are these different responses teaching you about the work needed to prepare for reparative research?</li>
      <li>Remember, blame and shame often become barriers to repair. This deck supports people in facing difficult truths in compassionate ways, balancing responsibility with generosity.</li>

    { text: "How is this research situated within the planetary metabolism? Research is not separate from the world—it is part of the planetary body. Does this study contribute to cycles of extraction, or does it nourish regenerative systems? Does it participate in life’s composting and renewal, or does it just accumulate?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
    { text: "Where does control masquerade as care? Interventions in nature and society are often framed as acts of care, but they can also be mechanisms of control. Does this research seek to metabolize and heal harm or simply manage it? How can care be reimagined in ways that don’t seek domination or affirmation?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
    { text: "What does this research assume about other-than-human beings? Does this study treat land, water, and non-human beings as objects to be studied—or as subjects with agency and intelligence that are participants in the research? Does this research assume we are separate from these beings or entangled with them, and what responsibilities and epistemic implications follow from this assumption?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" }
  ],
  repair: [
    { text: "What wound is this research addressing? All repair begins with acknowledging harm. What specific harm, rupture, or imbalance does this research seek to heal? Is the intervention appropriate for addressing this? Remember that harm is not limited to humans, and many wounds are collective, not individual.", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "Does this research seek to reform or reimagine? Some repairs reinforce the status quo; others create new possibilities. Does the project focus more on addressing the systemic causes of the issue I’m addressing, or more on mitigating the impacts of those causes in the existing system? Both are important, but how can I tell the difference, and how can I ensure that it is also clear for others?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "What collaborations would be required for genuine repair? Whose participation is necessary? Whose consent is required? Do we have these relationships, or do we need to build them? Are collaborators participating in all or some of the research (design, data collection, analysis, knowledge mobilization)? How will labor be compensated and credited? Remember the more-than-human collaborators, too.", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "What emotional labor is required for this repair? Reparative work is not just intellectual or structural—it is also affective. What and whose fears, griefs, or discomforts must be engaged for real repair to happen? Whose work is it to engage these? What emotional labor has this research not yet accounted for?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "How can we help ensure our research is accountable without feigning innocence? Searching for innocence and purity often results in a denial of complicity. How can we seek to enact repair while knowing that we, and the institutions we are part of, are also part of the problem?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "How can this research go beyond tokenistic and performative gestures of repair? Committing to repair is not the same as actually enacting it in practice. How does this research intend to return resources, power, and/or decision-making to the most affected communities? How does it seek to tangibly shift extractive and unequal relational dynamics toward trust, respect, reciprocity, accountability, and consent?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "Does this research treat repair as a process or a product? Does this research frame repair as a checklist or recognize it as emergent, adaptive, and relational? Have we accepted the possibility that this research might not result in the repair we seek, so that we don’t end up trying to force it? How is adaptability built into the research, so that it can shift as conditions and relations change?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "What assumptions does this research make about repair? If the research seeks to enact repair, what does it assume about what was broken, who did the breaking, and what repair looks like? What might change if, rather than approaching harm as something to be 'fixed,' it was something to compost—something that cannot be undone, but can be transformed into different conditions for what comes next?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "How can we avoid approaching repair in transactional ways? If repair becomes about 'settling a score,' then it is likely to be enacted as an exchange: a reparative effort in exchange for absolution. How can we ensure our repair includes relational repair, which includes but also goes beyond material restitution for extracted resources and exploited labor, and interrupts transactional relational dynamics?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
    { text: "How are funding decisions made within the project? How will resources be distributed across different collaborators? Does this distribution take into account uneven access to resources? Who has decision-making power over the project finances? Are there opportunities within the research design, implementation, and/or knowledge mobilization to direct project resources to marginalized communities?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" }
