  <button onclick="togglePreamble()">How to use this deck</button>
  <div id="preamble" class="preamble">
    <p>Even when research claims to be reparative, it often smuggles in old habits: the desire for mastery, the expectation of certainty, the assumption that knowledge is something to extract rather than something to be in relationship with. Knowledge-making, under these conditions, becomes another form of possession—one more way to accumulate, enclose, and control. This deck invites you to instead approach research as a set of relations. What happens when we treat research not as a tool of extraction, but as a field of entanglement.</p>
    <p>This deck does not offer answers, or straight paths. Instead, it threads its way through paradigms, loosening hardened assumptions, breaking down what no longer serves. It asks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What culturally-embedded assumptions are we unknowingly bringing to our research?</li>
      <li>What if research wasn’t about accumulating knowledge, but about composting harm?</li>
      <li>Where have we mistaken control for care?</li>
      <li>When is research not the appropriate response to harm?</li>
      <li>Where do we still refuse to be undone, even when undoing is necessary for repair?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are no clean or quick fixes here. Repair is not an event; it’s a multi-layered, non-linear metabolic process. It requires ongoing work, attention, and the willingness to be undone. It might result in new knowledge, but it also holds space for what cannot be known, should not be known, or refuses to be known.</p>
    <p><strong>How to use this deck:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shuffle the cards and see which one finds you. Sit with the questions on your own or as a group, or start your lab meetings by collectively processing one of the cards.</li>
      <li>Rather than simply answer the questions, consider what emotional and intellectual responses they bring up for you (you might have multiple responses that contradict each other). Which of your assumptions and investments do the questions challenge or affirm? What resistances do they activate? What are these different responses teaching you about the work needed to prepare for reparative research?</li>
      <li>Remember, blame and shame often become barriers to repair. This deck supports people in facing difficult truths in compassionate ways, balancing responsibility with generosity.</li>

        { text: "How is this research situated within the planetary metabolism? Research is not separate from the world—it is part of the planetary body. Does this study contribute to cycles of extraction, or does it nourish regenerative systems? Does it participate in life’s composting and renewal, or does it just accumulate?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "Where does control masquerade as care? Interventions in nature and society are often framed as acts of care, but they can also be mechanisms of control. Does this research seek to metabolize and heal harm or simply manage it? How can care be reimagined in ways that don’t seek domination or affirmation?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "What does this research assume about other-than-human beings? Does this study treat land, water, and non-human beings as objects to be studied—or as subjects with agency and intelligence that are participants in the research? Does this research assume we are separate from these beings or entangled with them, and what responsibilities and epistemic implications follow from this assumption?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "Where is the potential harm in this research? Research can cause harm not just through intent, but also through neglect, omission, or unintended consequences. If this work were to cause harm, what would it be? Does this study remove knowledge, data, or labor from a community, ecosystem, or way of knowing without consent and reciprocity? What safeguards could be built in to try and prevent harm?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "How does this research account for systemic inequities? How does the research take into account the disproportionate impact of the issue being examined on marginalized communities? How, if at all, does the project serve these communities? Is there any risk the project will further marginalize them? How can it be more accountable to these communities, even if not conducted in direct collaboration with them?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "What is the theory of change? How do we think the project will bring about change? Which (human and other-than-human) communities will benefit most from this change? Which communities might be negatively impacted? Does it attempt to produce and impose a one-size-fits-all solution? What would happen if the research embraced site-specific, relational, or plural interventions instead?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "What does refusal make possible? When research encounters resistance—by human communities and more-than-humans—it is important to respect refusal as a boundary. Who might refuse to participate in this research, and why? How can we ensure refusals by communities and knowledge holders will be honored rather than worked around? How do we recognize refusal beyond human voices?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "Should this research happen? More research is not always the right answer. What if the right move is unlearning, pausing, or redirecting resources rather than producing new knowledge? How can we balance responsibility with the humility of knowing that some harms can never fully be addressed?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "What structural constraints shape this research? How do academic timelines, funding structures, and publication pressures limit possibilities for repair? How can this research strategically and carefully challenge institutional expectations while prioritizing the integrity of relationships and the depth of inquiry? How do we resist the temptation to perform research for grants, careers, or recognition?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
        { text: "How will we decide which norms to follow, bend, and which to break? Every discipline has ruling norms and imaginaries, not all of which are explicit or conscious. Reparative research will likely require us to discern among which norms we can follow, bend, and break—how will we do so? Who will decide?", suit: "Identifying and Interrupting Extractive Logics" },
      ],
      repair: [
        { text: "What wound is this research addressing? All repair begins with acknowledging harm. What specific harm, rupture, or imbalance does this research seek to heal? Is the intervention appropriate for addressing this? Remember that harm is not limited to humans, and many wounds are collective, not individual.", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "Does this research seek to reform or reimagine? Some repairs reinforce the status quo; others create new possibilities. Does the project focus more on addressing the systemic causes of the issue I’m addressing, or more on mitigating the impacts of those causes in the existing system? Both are important, but how can I tell the difference, and how can I ensure that it is also clear for others?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "What collaborations would be required for genuine repair? Whose participation is necessary? Whose consent is required? Do we have these relationships, or do we need to build them? Are collaborators participating in all or some of the research (design, data collection, analysis, knowledge mobilization)? How will labor be compensated and credited? Remember the more-than-human collaborators, too.", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "What emotional labor is required for this repair? Reparative work is not just intellectual or structural—it is also affective. What and whose fears, griefs, or discomforts must be engaged for real repair to happen? Whose work is it to engage these? What emotional labor has this research not yet accounted for?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "How can we help ensure our research is accountable without feigning innocence? Searching for innocence and purity often results in a denial of complicity. How can we seek to enact repair while knowing that we, and the institutions we are part of, are also part of the problem?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "How can this research go beyond tokenistic and performative gestures of repair? Committing to repair is not the same as actually enacting it in practice. How does this research intend to return resources, power, and/or decision-making to the most affected communities? How does it seek to tangibly shift extractive and unequal relational dynamics toward trust, respect, reciprocity, accountability, and consent?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "Does this research treat repair as a process or a product? Does this research frame repair as a checklist or recognize it as emergent, adaptive, and relational? Have we accepted the possibility that this research might not result in the repair we seek, so that we don’t end up trying to force it? How is adaptability built into the research, so that it can shift as conditions and relations change?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "What assumptions does this research make about repair? If the research seeks to enact repair, what does it assume about what was broken, who did the breaking, and what repair looks like? What might change if, rather than approaching harm as something to be 'fixed,' it was something to compost—something that cannot be undone, but can be transformed into different conditions for what comes next?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "How can we avoid approaching repair in transactional ways? If repair becomes about 'settling a score,' then it is likely to be enacted as an exchange: a reparative effort in exchange for absolution. How can we ensure our repair includes relational repair, which includes but also goes beyond material restitution for extracted resources and exploited labor, and interrupts transactional relational dynamics?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" },
        { text: "How are funding decisions made within the project? How will resources be distributed across different collaborators? Does this distribution take into account uneven access to resources? Who has decision-making power over the project finances? Are there opportunities within the research design, implementation, and/or knowledge mobilization to direct project resources to marginalized communities?", suit: "Toward Material, Relational, Epistemic, and Affective Repair" }
      ],
      politics: [
        { text: "What histories does this research carry? All fields of knowledge emerge from particular historical and cultural contexts—many of which are entangled with colonialism, capitalism, or exclusion. How does this research acknowledge or obscure its own lineage? What historical responsibilities does it have?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "How does this research distribute expertise? Does it treat certain voices as ‘experts’ while relegating others to the margins? How does it disrupt or reinforce existing hierarchies of knowledge? How does it seek to ensure collaborators with less systemic power are not only able to voice their perspectives (including critical concerns), but also have those perspectives heard by those on the project with more power?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "Who has already been engaged in this research? How does my project try to interrupt the assumption that academic researchers are the only (or primary) knowledge producers? How can we acknowledge and amplify the voices of those who have been engaged in reparative research and practice already—many of whom are the ones most directly affected by the problem this research seeks to address?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "Who benefits from this research and who bears its costs? Why is this project important and for whom? Who gains power, resources, or recognition from this research? Who absorbs the risks or is left vulnerable? If the answer is uneven, could reparative adjustments be made, or does the entire project need to be rethought? How am I benefitting from this research, and what responsibilities do I have as a result?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "What happens when this knowledge is set loose in the world? Once this research is published, who might use it? For what purposes? How will the research team be accountable to those who are most affected by the research, especially if it is misused or weaponized?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "How can we discern the roles of different knowledge systems in repair? Some assert Western knowledge cannot address the problems Western knowledge created. Others assert the opposite: only Western knowledge can address the problems that Western knowledge created. How does the research consider both these perspectives and where they are coming from?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "How is this research accounting for institutionalized legacies of harm? New research is shaped by the knowledge it draws and builds on. Consider: In what ways has my field and my institution contributed to harm? In what ways have the harmful legacies of my field and my institution shaped this research project?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "What temporalities does this research reinforce? Some research is fueled by urgency and desires for immediate solutions, which can lead to rushed or extractive interventions. Does this work assume repair is about moving “forward” (and in a particular direction)? What would change if we moved at the speed of trust instead of an academic or funding deadline? How can we still do good work under time pressures?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "How can we shift our research from ‘doing to’ to ‘being with’? Reparative research recognizes research as an ongoing entanglement—where what is studied is not only shaped by, but also shapes and implicates, the researchers. Do the researchers frame themselves as independent agents, or do they acknowledge themselves as participants in relational dynamics of the research that are already in motion?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" },
        { text: "Do we know when to let research decompose? Research is rarely timeless. The implications of findings change over time, becoming less relevant or even dangerous. How can we identify the paradigms, theories, and even fields that need to rot? How can our research account for its own changing relevance and meaning over time? How can we be accountable in the long term—even after the project is over?", suit: "The Politics of Knowledge" }
      ],
      pluralizing: [
        { text: "Who is missing? Every study, model, or dataset includes choices about who/what is seen and who/what is erased. What perspectives, knowledge systems, or more-than-human intelligences are absent in this research? What shifts if they are included—in substantive rather than tokenistic ways?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "How might this research change if future generations were watching? If those living 50 years from now were here, what would they say about our work? Would they see it as a gift, a burden, an apology? What might change about the research if their needs were centered? What is keeping this research from more fully accepting its intergenerational responsibilities (including to generations past, present, and future)?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "What knowledges have been dismissed as unscientific or irrational—and why? Dominant knowledge systems often marginalize oral traditions, spiritual epistemologies, or ways of knowing deeply rooted in lived experience. What insights have been overlooked by our field because they do not fit within conventional academic research frames? How does our research relate to these other ways of knowing?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "What voices are present but not truly respected? If marginalized voices are included in this research, are they shaping the core questions and frameworks, or are they just being cited as sources of raw data? Are different perspectives valued only as an epistemic asset or as an invitation into relational transformation? Who decides (e.g., where “forward” is, what the project should focus on, to what end)?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "What would this research look like if the Earth had a seat at the table? If a river, soil, or wind were active participants in this study, how would the research change? What questions would they ask? What would this research look like if the Earth didn’t just contribute to it, but led the design of it?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "Is there space for the unknown—and the unknowable? Research is often motivated by the search for certainty and mastery, and the presumption that researchers are entitled to access all knowledges. How can we accept that not all knowledge will be shared with us—and we may not “understand” even that which is shared? What might happen if we made more space for the unknown and the unknowable?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "How does/will this research navigate language and translation? Does this research assume dominant academic language is the default? How does it engage or neglect translation—not just linguistically, but culturally and contextually? What are the limits of translation—e.g., do we know how to ‘translate’ a tree?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "How does this research recognize and metabolize complicity? Reparative research needs to create space to hold the discomfort of complicity without immediately seeking absolution or action. How does this research move beyond a reactionary 'guilt-to-action' impulse toward sustained accountability?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "What aspects of repair are outside the scope of this research? No project can do everything. What parts of repair does this research engage well, and what aspects require other interventions? What would reparative research look like if it prioritized relationships rather than outcomes, and what are the barriers to enacting this approach?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" },
        { text: "Are we accounting for complexities? How does this research take into account the multiple moving layers and complexities that go into creating the problem that the project seeks to address? How can we discern which of these layers to focus on (since it is impossible to focus on all of them at once)?", suit: "Pluralizing Perspectives" }
      ],
      reflexivity: [
        { text: "How does this research account for the researcher’s positionality? Researchers are not neutral observers—they bring their own histories, biases, and assumptions to the work. How does this research acknowledge and reflect on the positionality of the researchers involved? How does it account for the ways in which the researchers’ identities and experiences shape the research process and outcomes?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "What assumptions are embedded in this research? All research is shaped by underlying assumptions—about the world, about knowledge, about what is worth studying. What assumptions are embedded in this research, and how do they shape the questions, methods, and interpretations? How can we make these assumptions explicit and critically examine them?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research engage with power dynamics? Research is not just about knowledge—it’s also about power. How does this research engage with the power dynamics between researchers and participants, between different knowledge systems, and within the research team? How does it seek to address and mitigate these dynamics?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "What ethical considerations are involved in this research? All research involves ethical considerations—about consent, about harm, about responsibility. What ethical considerations are involved in this research, and how are they being addressed? How does the research seek to balance the pursuit of knowledge with the responsibility to do no harm?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research account for its own limitations? No research is perfect—every study has limitations. How does this research account for its own limitations, and how does it seek to address them? How does it acknowledge the gaps and uncertainties in the knowledge it produces?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research engage with different perspectives? Research is enriched by engaging with diverse perspectives—across disciplines, cultures, and experiences. How does this research engage with different perspectives, and how does it seek to incorporate them into the research process and outcomes?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research reflect on its own impact? Research has real-world impacts—on communities, on policies, on the environment. How does this research reflect on its own impact, and how does it seek to be accountable for the consequences of its findings? How does it engage with the communities and contexts it affects?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research foster reflexivity? Reflexivity is about critically reflecting on the research process and the researcher’s role within it. How does this research foster reflexivity, and how does it seek to create space for ongoing reflection and learning?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research engage with uncertainty? Research often involves navigating uncertainty—about the world, about knowledge, about the future. How does this research engage with uncertainty, and how does it seek to embrace it as part of the research process?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" },
        { text: "How does this research contribute to broader conversations? Research is part of broader conversations—within academia, within communities, within society. How does this research contribute to these conversations, and how does it seek to engage with and amplify diverse voices?", suit: "Fostering Reflexivity" }
